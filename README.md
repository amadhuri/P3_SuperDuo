# Alexandria
This project is part of Super Duo project.

# Assignment - Alexandria
Alexandria is a barcode scanner app. Books barcodes can be added by capturing the bar code or entering the ISBN number. With ISBN number the book details are fetched.

# Alexandria app changes
1. Scan functionality was not working previously. Fixed this issue.
2. Deleting the book from detail view navigates back to books list view. The deleted book is still shown in the list. Fixed this bug.
3. If there is no network connection, Alexandria app crashes. Fixed this issue.
